<h2>MID project.rtf:</h2> <p> SQL Movie Rental Analysis: Explore Films, Actors, Customers, & Revenue (using functions)
This repository analyzes a movie rental dataset using SQL queries, focusing on these functionalities:

Main Functions:
<ul>
<li>Aggregation: COUNT, SUM, AVG - Analyze film count, revenue, and average values.</li>
<li>Grouping: GROUP BY - Organize data by category, district, or other criteria.</li>
<li>Filtering: WHERE, HAVING - Select specific data based on conditions.</li>
<li>Joining: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN - Combine related data from different tables.</li>
<li>Subqueries: Nested queries for complex calculations like finding maximum revenue.</li>
<li>Case expressions: Categorize data based on conditions (e.g., replacement cost ranges).</li>
</ul>

Explore data on:
<ul>
<li>Film inventory: cost, categories, lengths</li>
<li>Actor appearances</li>
<li>Customer demographics and spending habits</li>
<li>Staff performance and revenue generation</li>
<li>Gain insights into movie rentals and make informed business decisions.</li>
</ul>
</p>

 <h2>Project_no2</h2>
  <p>
    This repository contains SQL practice problems and their solutions.

The problems cover various difficulty levels, from moderate to advanced, and test different functionalities like data manipulation, aggregation, window functions, and subqueries.

The tasks explore various aspects of working with a sample employee database, including:
<ul>
<li>Updating employee information (promotion, salary raises, position title change)</li>
<li>Calculating averages and totals (average salary per position, total company salary)</li>
  <li>Creating new columns with derived data (combining names, checking active status)</li>
  <li>Working with date data (running total salary)</li>
  <li>Using window functions (average salary per job position)</li>
</ul>
The provided code demonstrates the use of SQL statements like:

<ul>
<li>SELECT: Used to retrieve data from tables.</li>
  <li>UPDATE: Used to modify existing data in tables.</li>
  <li>CREATE VIEW: Used to create a virtual table based on a query.</li>
  <li>GROUP BY: Used to group data and perform aggregate functions like calculating averages.</li>
  <li>CASE statements: Used to define conditional logic within the query.</li>
  <li>Window functions: Functions that operate on a set of rows within a query partition (e.g., calculating average salary per position).</li>
</ul>
</p>

This repository can be a valuable resource for anyone who wants to practice and improve their SQL skills.
